    "1. **procM** gene sequences were detected in marine cyanobacterial genomes using the **pre-computed phylogenetic tree viewer in the microbesonline database** (http://www.microbesonline.org (3), which is computed using FastBLAST (4), see http://www.microbesonline.org/treebrowseHelp.html for additional details). \n",
    "2. **procA** sequences were detected in the genomes of Prochlorococcus **MIT9313** by **manually searching for short ORFs close to the procM gene** that encoded a **peptide** with a **leader sequence** followed by a **double-glycine** protease recognition site and a **short** core peptide rich in **Cys, Ser and Thr** residues (Fig. 1C). \n",
    "3. Once several such putative lantipeptides were discovered, we used **BLASTp** in both **microbesonline** and the **NCBI nr** database (with a cutoff **e-value of 10**) to detect other, similar genes in cyanobacterial genomes\n",
    "4.  **manually** checked the resulting peptide sequences to verify that they agreed with the definition of procAs, as described above. \n",
    "5. Figure 1 and Figure S1 were produced using IMG (http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi)."
