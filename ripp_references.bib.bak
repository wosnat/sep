  abstract  = {Lanthipeptides are ribosomally derived peptide secondary metabo-
lites that undergo extensive posttranslational modification. Prochlor-
osins are a group of lanthipeptides produced by certain strains of the
ubiquitous marine picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synecho-
coccus. Unlike other lanthipeptide-producing bacteria, picocyanobac-
teria use an unprecedented mechanism of substrate promiscuity for
the production of numerous and diverse lanthipeptides using a single
lanthionine synthetase. Through a cross-scale analysis of prochlorosin
biosynthesis genes—from genomes to oceanic populations—we
show that marine picocyanobacteria have the collective capacity to
encode thousands of different cyclic peptides, few of which would
display similar ring topologies. To understand how this extensive
structural diversity arises, we used deep sequencing of wild popula-
tions to reveal genetic variation patterns in prochlorosin genes. We
present evidence that structural variability among prochlorosins is the
result of a diversifying selection process that favors large, rather than
small, sequence changes in the precursor peptide genes. This mode of
molecular evolution disregards any conservation of the ancestral
structure and enables the emergence of extensively different cyclic
peptides through short mutational paths based on indels. Contrary to
its fast-evolving peptide substrates, the prochlorosin lanthionine syn-
thetase evolves under a strong purifying selection, indicating that the
diversification of prochlorosins is not constrained by commensurate
changes in the biosynthetic enzyme. This evolutionary interplay be-
tween the prochlorosin peptide substrates and the lanthionine syn-
thetase suggests that structure diversification, rather than structure
refinement, is the driving force behind the creation of new prochlor-
osin structures and represents an intriguing mechanism by which
natural product diversity arises.},

  abstract  = {Our understanding of secondary metabolite production in bacteria
has been shaped primarily by studies of attached varieties such as
symbionts, pathogens, and soil bacteria. Here we show that a
strain of the single-celled, planktonic marine cyanobacterium Pro-
chlorococcus—which conducts a sizable fraction of photosynthesis
in the oceans—produces many cyclic, lanthionine-containing
peptides (lantipeptides). Remarkably, in Prochlorococcus MIT9313
a single promiscuous enzyme transforms up to 29 different linear
ribosomally synthesized peptides into a library of polycyclic,
conformationally constrained products with highly diverse ring
topologies. Genes encoding this system arefound in variable abun-
dances across the oceans—with a hot spot in a Galapagos hypersa-
line lagoon—suggesting they play a habitat- and/or community-
specific role. The extraordinarily efficient pathway for generating
structural diversity enables these cyanobacteria to produce as
many secondary metabolites as model antibiotic-producing bacter-
ia, but with much smaller genomes.},

Here, we show that two strains of the globally abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus,
MED4 and MIT9313, which belong to two different ecotypes, differ markedly in their response to co-
culture with a marine heterotrophic bacterium, Alteromonas macleodii strain HOT1A3. HOT1A3
enhanced the growth of MIT9313 at low cell densities, yet inhibited it at a higher concentration,
whereas it had no effect on MED4 growth. The early transcriptomic responses of Prochlorococcus
cells after 20 h in co-culture showed no evidence of nutrient starvation, whereas the expression of
genes involved in photosynthesis, protein synthesis and stress responses typically decreased in
MED4 and increased in MIT313. Differential expression of genes involved in outer membrane
modification, efflux transporters and, in MIT9313, lanthipeptides (prochlorosins) suggests that
Prochlorococcus mount a specific response to the presence of the heterotroph in the cultures.
Intriguingly, many of the differentially-expressed genes encoded short proteins, including two new
families of co-culture responsive genes: CCRG-1, which is found across the Prochlorococcus lineage
and CCRG-2, which contains a sequence motif involved in the export of prochlorosins and other
bacteriocin-like peptides, and are indeed released from the cells into the media.},

We report RODEO (Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online), which combines hidden Markov model-based analysis, heuristic scoring, and machine learning to identify biosynthetic gene clusters and predict RiPP precursor peptides. We initially focused on lasso peptides, which display intriguing physiochemical properties and bioactivities, but their hypervariability renders them challenging prospects for automated mining. Our approach yielded the most comprehensive mapping of lasso peptide space, revealing >1,300 compounds. We characterized the structures and bioactivities of six lasso peptides, prioritized based on predicted structural novelty, including an unprecedented handcuff-like topology and another with a citrulline modification exceptionally rare among bacteria. These combined insights significantly expand the knowledge of lasso peptides, and more broadly, provide a framework for future genome-mining efforts.},

  abstract  = {Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a rapidly growing natural product class. RiPP precursor peptides can undergo extensive enzymatic tailoring, yielding structurally and functionally diverse products, and their biosynthetic logic makes them attractive bioengineering targets. Recent work suggests that unrelated RiPP modifying enzymes contain structurally similar precursor peptide-binding domains. Using profile hidden Markov model comparisons, we discovered related and previously unrecognized peptide-binding domains in proteins spanning the majority of known prokaryotic RiPP classes; thus, we named this conserved domain the RiPP precursor peptide recognition element (RRE). Through binding studies, we verify the role of the RRE for three distinct RiPP classes: linear azole-containing peptides, thiopeptides, and lasso peptides. Because numerous RiPP biosynthetic enzymes act on peptide substrates, our findings have powerful predictive value as to which protein(s) drive substrate binding, laying a foundation for further characterization of RiPP biosynthetic pathways and the rational engineering of new peptide-binding activities.},

Transcription factor motifs (including those discovered using MEME) can be compared with motifs in many popular motif databases using the motif database scanning algorithm Tomtom. Transcription factor motifs can be further analyzed for putative function by association with Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the motif-GO term association tool GOMO. MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS for each discovered motif, as well as buttons to allow motifs to be conveniently submitted to the sequence and motif database scanning algorithms (MAST, FIMO and Tomtom), or to GOMO, for further analysis. GLAM2 output similarly contains buttons for further analysis using GLAM2SCAN and for rerunning GLAM2 with different parameters. All of the motif-based tools are now implemented as web services via Opal. Source code, binaries and a web server are freely available for noncommercial use at http://meme.nbcr.net.},

This paradigm shift also resulted in a high demand for computational tools to assist researchers in their daily work. In this context, this review gives a summary of tools and databases that currently are available to mine, identify and characterize natural product biosynthesis pathways and their producers based on ‘omics data. A web portal called Secondary Metabolite Bioinformatics Portal (SMBP at http://www.secondarymetabolites.org) is introduced to provide a one-stop catalog and links to these bioinformatics resources.

Here, we used a novel algorithm to systematically identify BGCs in the extensive extant microbial sequencing data. Network analysis of the predicted BGCs revealed large gene cluster families, the vast majority uncharacterized. We experimentally characterized the most prominent family, consisting of two subfamilies of hundreds of BGCs distributed throughout the Proteobacteria; their products are aryl polyenes, lipids with an aryl head group conjugated to a polyene tail. We identified a distant relationship to a third subfamily of aryl polyene BGCs, and together the three subfamilies represent the largest known family of biosynthetic gene clusters, with more than 1,000 members. Although these clusters are widely divergent in sequence, their small molecule products are remarkably conserved, indicating for the first time the important roles these compounds play in Gram-negative cell biology.},
