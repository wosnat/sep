  abstract  = {A large body of evidence indicates that genome annotation pipelines have biased our view of coding sequences because they generally undersample small proteins and peptides. The recent development of genome-wide translation profiling reveals the prevalence of small/short open reading frames (smORFs or sORFs), which are scattered over all classes of transcripts, including both mRNAs and presumptive long noncoding RNAs. Proteomic approaches further confirm an unexpected variety of smORF-encoded peptides (SEPs), representing an overlooked reservoir of bioactive molecules. Indeed, functional studies in a broad range of species from yeast to humans demonstrate that SEPs can harbor key activities for the control of development, differentiation, and physiology. Here we summarize recent advances in the discovery and functional characterization of smORF/SEPs and discuss why these small players can no longer be ignored with regard to genome function.},
